# Student Managment System?

## ðŸš¨ Problem
Create a student management system for classes that saves students' names. Maximum is 1000 student per class. Each name only have max of 30 characters. The system must have the following features:

- [x] Add students 
- [ ] Sort student names
- [x] Print student list

## âž• Additional work
Optimize the sorting algorithm by using pointers... sadge

## ðŸ‘€ Issues

- Sorting is... weird
- Need some formatting and presentation
- Definitely not optimized!!!
